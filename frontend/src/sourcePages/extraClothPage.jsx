// This is the page for the extra cloth report, which includes the navigation bar and three sections.

// It fetches all submissions assigned to the logged-in staff member and filters them to find submissions with "Extra" or "Custom" clothes.

// It also calculates the total submission price for each user and identifies users whose total amount across all submissions exceeds 500, displaying all their submissions in Section 1. Sections 2 and 3 handle other aspects of the extra cloth report.
// The navigation bar displays the total number of extra or custom cloth requests assigned to the staff member.
