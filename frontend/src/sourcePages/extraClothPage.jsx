// This is the page for the extra cloth report, which includes the navigation bar and three sections.

// It fetches all submissions assigned to the logged-in staff member and filters them to find submissions with "Extra" or "Custom" clothes.

// It also calculates the total submission price for each user and identifies users whose total amount across all submissions exceeds 500, displaying all their submissions in Section 1. Sections 2 and 3 handle other aspects of the extra cloth report.
// The navigation bar displays the total number of extra or custom cloth requests assigned to the staff member.
// The code is modular, with separate components for the navigation bar and each section, promoting maintainability and scalability.
// Error handling is included for the data fetching process to ensure robustness.
// The page uses React hooks for state management and side effects, ensuring a modern and efficient implementation.
// The page is designed to be part of a larger application, integrating seamlessly with other components and pages.
// The page is optimized for performance, minimizing unnecessary re-renders and ensuring smooth user interactions.
// The page includes comments to explain the functionality and logic, aiding future developers in understanding the code.
